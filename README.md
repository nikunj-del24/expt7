EXPERIMENT 7 STUDY OF CONDITIONAL STATEMENT IN PYTHON.

THEORY-
In this experiment we are going to discuss while loop and its uses we had to declare a variable, then while loop starts with a condition then the iteration takes place. It is used to find factorial of a number by declaring condition of n>0 for i=n and i*=n and n-=1. It is used for finding fibonacci series like first we had to give 0 and 1 then then we had to proceed with the sum of last two number given and it will give the desired sum upto the limit of our choice for example we had given limit 4 then the output would be 0 1 1 2 3. It is used to check for a reverse of a number if we had given any number like 1234 then using while loop we can reverse that number to 4321 and if on reversing we are getting same number like 121 on reversing is same as 121 then that number is known as palindrome number. The same we can do with the string like madam is a palindrome string. We can use while loop for counting number of digits in a number for example in 123 we had three digits. We can also use while loop for searching any element in an array. If we want to print only odd numbers or only even numbers in a specified range then we can use while loop to do it.
